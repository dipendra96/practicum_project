# Synthetic Medical Data Generation - Capgemini
This repo is for Capgemini practicum project for generating medical and pharmacy claims data.

## Loading the data
Use load_data.ipynb to load data from parquet zip to csv files. This notebook could run for both medical claims data and pharmacy claims data.

## Merging medical and pharmacy claims data
Use merge_med_pharm_data.ipynb to merge the medical claims data with pharmacy claims data. Because of memory restriction. we are only taking one pharmacy claim per medical claim per member life id which could be easily changed in the SQL provided in this notebook.

## Evaluation
Evaluation_Script.ipynb can be used to evaluate the data generated by any model and examine how well it represents the original dataset. It performs evaluation for both numerical and categorical variables and also perform PCA, t-SNE and plot distribution plots
